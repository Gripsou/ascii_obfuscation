Project Directory
=================

This is the directory where project files are stored

At the moment, there is one folder for Code::Blocks and another dedicated
to raw Makefile (using GCC) project.

_CLion_ project files are hosted at project root for usability reasons.
It might be as well with _eclipse_ and / or _VisualStudio_ if I try to add
those IDE project files in the future. But, I would do my best to put them
here.
